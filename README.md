# Self_Paced_Learning

> This is a collection of Python path and Machine Learning that are split by [topics](#table-of-contents) and contain
code examples with explanations, different use cases and links to further readings.

It is a **Help Book** because you may change or add the code to see how it works
and [test it out](#testing-the-code) using assertions. Altogether it might make your learning process to be more interactive and it might help you to keep
code quality pretty high from very beginning.

## Python
![Python](https://www.python.org/static/img/python-logo@2x.png)

Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
