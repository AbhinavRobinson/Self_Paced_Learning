# Self_Paced_Learning

> This is a collection of Python and Machine Learning resources that are aimed to provide continuous learning of concepts through practical code examples, different use cases and links to further readings.

It is a **Help Book** because you may change or add the code to see how different aspects correlate with each other
and [test it out](#testing-the-code) using assertions. Altogether it will make your learning process to be much more interactive and expose you to very high code quality from beginning.

## Python
![Python](https://www.python.org/static/img/python-logo@2x.png)

Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

## Machine Learning

Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
